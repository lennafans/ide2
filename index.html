    <h1>How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</h1>
    <p>
      The question about weather changes in the past 100 years becomes
      increasingly relevant following the large impact of global warming,
      leading to fatal disruption of the human food chain, decrease of
      inhabitable land mass and mass-extinction.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Denmark is located in a very stable geological region. There are no
      large tectonic plates causing earthquakes and the Gulf stream and
      temperate climate keeps the temperature level low, but constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperature for a stable region like Denmark over the course of ~100
      years provides a good baseline for temperature analysis over time.
      In particular we will be able to detect consistent anormalities,
      indicating that the weather changes are not just sporadic but consistent
      and long-lasting.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      We have collected data through the
      <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/" title="GISS">
        Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a> who have collected data from
        Tarm, Denmark from 1880 to 1969. The data sums the temperature for
        each month for each period.
    </p>
    <h3>Data anormalities</h3>
    <p>
      The data had some anormalities and odd readings we filtered out. We also
      removed missing data points completely without any attempt at
      interpolation.
