    <h1>How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</h1>
    <p>
      The question about weather changes in the past 100 years becomes
      increasingly relevant following the large impact of global warming,
      leading to fatal disruption of the human food chain, decrease of
      inhabitable land mass and mass-extinction.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Denmark is located in a very stable geological region. There are no
      large tectonic plates causing earthquakes and the Gulf stream and
      temperate climate keeps the temperature level low, but constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperature for a stable region like Denmark over the course of ~100
      years provides a good baseline for temperature analysis over time.
      In particular we will be able to detect consistent anormalities,
      indicating that the weather changes are not just sporadic but consistent
      and long-lasting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the effects of industrialisation and emissions of green house
      gasses starting in the late 1900s, we expect to see that the temperature
      will be rising over the past 100 years.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      We have collected data through the
      <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/" title="GISS">
        Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a> who have collected data from
        Tarm, Denmark from 1880 to 1969. The data contains the average
        temperature for each month.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data was preprocessed by fitting the format into a <code>csv</code>.
      The data also had some anormalities and odd readings we filtered out.
      Missing data points was completely removed without any attempt at
      interpolation.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      To test the assumption that the temperature is generally rising we are
      plotting the average temperature for each year from 1880 to 1969. The
      plot shows that the temperature in the western Jutland is on average
      between 6 and 9 degrees celsius, and has been for the last 100 years.
      There might be a small inclination - particularly after the 1940s - but
      the graph does not provide any concluding evidence.

    degrees celsius.</p>
    <p>
      Since no apparent tendencies were observed, we created a new plot using the average temperature in the summer months and winter months. While there doesn't seem to be a general increase in temperature neither in the summer or winter, the temperatures in the winter months seem to be a lot more fluctuating with more extreme temperature differences. The winter months seem to account for the larger fluctuations in the average temperature in figure 1.

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <h3>Data discussion(Dan)</h3>
    <p>
    To research the topic of this article more thoroughly, it would be paramount to include data from other regions (both nationally and internationally). Using temperature data from a single region is far from sufficient to make generalizations about weather changes in a meaningful way. Due to the many variables in weather changes, one region could be subject to a great decrease in temperature over several hundred years, while the global temperature was steadily increasing.
    <p>Another interesting variable to include in the analysis would be the water temperature. Land temperatures are usually more stochastic in nature, and the data will therefore be more unreliable and contain a greater number of outliers and uncertainties. Water temperatures are more constant, and a strong increase in water temperature, is therefore a stronger indication of general weather change than land temperature alone.
    <p>It's also important to point out that the NASA dataset only contains weather data from 1880 to 1969 from the city of Tarm which we chose as our geographical area. Looking at the
    <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/">Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index</a>
    from NASA, we see that the global land and water temperatures have only increased since 1969 and the tendency have gotten stronger since then as well.


    <h3>Dynamic visualisation (Jens)</h3>
    <p>
      Our plots focus on the development of one (average) temperature over
      time. It would be interesting to allow the user to see the general
      overview and then dig into the specifics, if it has any interest. The
      could be approached from two angles:

      <ol>
        <li>Either the user could be met with a general view, providing a quick
          overview of the situation. The view would invite to interaction,
          allowing the user to 'zoom' into particular areas of interest. This
          would give the user a quick intuition about the situation
          due to the reduced complexity. The drawback is that it might not be
          trivial to display this in a way that provides the necessary
          information while also inviting for interaction.
        </li>
        <li>Another approach is to present the user with a view of all the
          data at once. The user can then dive into the data by 'slicing' it
          in a way that is important for him/her. The advantage of this is that
          it does not require any cognitive capacity to remember where in the
          data you are, because the display stays the same. The disadvantage
          is that the data can be hard to portray in a way that does not
          confuse the user unnecessarily. One quite successful example of this
          approach has been developed by Peter Cook, showing the
          <a href="http://charts.animateddata.co.uk/uktemperaturelines">
          Temperature history in the UK</a>. He managed to plot the temperature
          outlines in a way that is easy to understand. The exact correlation
          between each year is hard to understand, but it allows for users to
          easily dig further into a certain year.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Assuming that the temperature of Tarm, Denmark, would generally be
      rising throughout the last 100 years, we visually analysed data collected
      from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Our analysis showed that
      while there seems to be a general trend toward higher temperature, the
      data was insufficient to draw any lasting conclusions.
