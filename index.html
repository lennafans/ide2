    <h1>How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</h1>
    <p>
      The question about weather changes in the past 100 years becomes
      increasingly relevant following the large impact of global warming,
      leading to fatal disruption of the human food chain, decrease of
      inhabitable land mass and mass-extinction.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Denmark is located in a very stable geological region. There are no
      large tectonic plates causing earthquakes and the Gulf stream and
      temperate climate keeps the temperature level low, but constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temperature for a stable region like Denmark over the course of ~100
      years provides a good baseline for temperature analysis over time.
      In particular we will be able to detect consistent anormalities,
      indicating that the weather changes are not just sporadic but consistent
      and long-lasting.
    </p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      We have collected data through the
      <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/" title="GISS">
        Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a> who have collected data from
        Tarm, Denmark from 1880 to 1969. The data sums the temperature for
        each month for each period.
    </p>
    <h3>Data anormalities</h3>
    <p>
      The data had some anormalities and odd readings we filtered out. We also
      removed missing data points completely without any attempt at
      interpolation.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <h3>Dynamic visualisation (Jens)</h3>
    <p>
      Our plots focus on the development of one (average) temperature over
      time. It would be interesting to allow the user to see the general
      overview and then dig into the specifics, if it has any interest. The
      could be approached from two angles:

      <ol>
        <li>Either the user could be met with a general view, providing a quick
          overview of the situation. The view would invite to interaction,
          allowing the user to 'zoom' into particular areas of interest. This
          would give the user a quick intuition about the situation
          due to the reduced complexity. The drawback is that it might not be
          trivial to display this in a way that provides the necessary
          information while also inviting for interaction.
        </li>
        <li>Another approach is to present the user with a view of all the
          data at once. The user can then dive into the data by 'slicing' it
          in a way that is important for him/her. The advantage of this is that
          it does not require any cognitive capacity to remember where in the
          data you are, because the display stays the same. The disadvantage
          is that the data can be hard to portray in a way that does not
          confuse the user unnecessarily. One quite successful example of this
          approach has been developed by Peter Cook, showing the
          <a href="http://charts.animateddata.co.uk/uktemperaturelines">
          Temperature history in the UK</a>. He managed to plot the temperature
          outlines in a way that is easy to understand. The exact correlation
          between each year is hard to understand, but it allows for users to
          easily dig further into a certain year.</li>
      </ol>
